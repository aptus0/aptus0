## About

I am a software developer focused on Salesforce Platform development, backend systems, and API-driven architectures.  
My primary expertise lies in Apex-based development, CRM-oriented business logic, and scalable backend design.

I approach software development with an emphasis on clarity, security, and long-term maintainability.  
Rather than focusing only on implementation, I aim to design systems that are understandable, testable, and production-ready.

My background across multiple programming languages and platforms allows me to work comfortably across different layers of a system — from data modeling and API design to platform-level integrations.
